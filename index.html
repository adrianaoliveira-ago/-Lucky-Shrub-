          <p>
            Based in Tuscon, Arizona, Lucky Shrub is a medium-sized garden
            design firm that specializes in garden design and creation,
            maintenance and landscaping. The company also runs a small plant
            nursery that sells indoor and outdoor plants, making them a one-stop
            shop for clients to "transform any space into an oasis you can be
            proud of". Lucky Shrub was started by a husband and wife team, Jason
            and Maria, who share a long-time love for plants. Jason is the
            garden architect. He creates and oversees all designs while managing
            his team of landscapers. Maria manages all the marketing for the
            company and oversees the nursery.
